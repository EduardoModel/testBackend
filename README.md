# testBackend
### An adventure with the TDD methodology and a skillful joker

In this project was utilized the TDD aproach to in
conjuction with the [Jest Framework](https://jestjs.io/) to write and run the tests;
Together was utilized the [Faker Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker) and the [Factory Girl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/factory-girl) to generate random data to
populate the database during the test runs;

The MVC model was adopted to develop the application, utilizing [Postgre](https://www.postgresql.org/) as database and
[Sequelize](http://sequelize.org/) as ORM to manage the models of the application.

To run the tests is basically to call the *test* script via the package manager.
